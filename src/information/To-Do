To Do List:
(*) = Optional but cool
	HTML:
		1.) ( ) *Edit URL section on index page
		2.) ( ) Delete URL via ID section on index page
		3.) ( ) Page sorter, hides unused sections of page for focus with selection boxes (Hides the bordered Add URL, or Delete URL, or Edit URL sections, based on selection
	Java:
		1.) ( ) Create all servlets for editing, adding, and deleting from SQL DB via ListItemHelper.
		2.) ( ) Create TableAssessment entity to store threat assessment details like "Severity Rating" and "Threat Assessment"
		3.) ( ) *API to test if the link can be pinged correctly?
		
	Notes:
		1.) Make sure that "threat" details are being pushed to new table creation and not to "links" DB/Table
		2.) When creating methods to delete from the SQL database when we want to delete ID 1 for table "links" we need to delete ID 2 from "assessments"
		
	
	
	
	Current Structure:
		Index Page (User inputs information)
			Servlet 1 (Retrieves link information using LinkHelper)

			"links" SQL DB
				Entity Links

					String link;
        			String time;
        			String description;
